User Story 1

As a User,
in order to see all bookmarks I've saved,
I want to see a list of my bookmarks.

Bookmarks   User
list_all

Client -> request (GET) -> Controller -> Model -> View
/bookmarks <- response <- app.rb <- class Bookmark <- bookmarks.erb


User Story 2

As a time-pressed user
So that I can save a website
I would like to add the site's address and title to bookmark manager


...

Database:
psql bookmarks

Connect to database:
\c bookmarks 

Inspect the list of tables:
\dt (should include a "bookmarks" table)
