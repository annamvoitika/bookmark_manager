User Story 1

As a User,
in order to see all bookmarks I've saved,
I want to see a list of my bookmarks.

Bookmarks   User
list_all

/bookmarks <- response <- app.rb <- class Bookmark <- bookmarks.erb


User Story 2

As a time-pressed user
So that I can save a website
I would like to add the site's address and title to bookmark manager

User Story 3

As a use 
So that I can add more bookmarks
I would like to add bookmarks to a bookmark list
...

Database:
psql bookmarks

Connect to database:
\c bookmarks

Inspect the list of tables:
\dt (should include a "bookmarks" table)

To create a test database, follow the steps below:

1.Run psql postgres in the terminal
2.Run CREATE DATABASE "bookmarks_test"; to create a database
3.Run CREATE TABLE bookmarks (id SERIAL, url VARCHAR(60)); to create a table

Before running rspec:
ruby ./spec/setup_test_database.rb

Example of feature test with a database:

require 'pg'

feature 'Viewing bookmarks' do
  scenario 'A user can see bookmarks' do
    connection = PG.connect(dbname: 'bookmark_manager_test')

    # Add the test data
    connection.exec("INSERT INTO bookmarks VALUES(1, 'http://www.makersacademy.com');")
    connection.exec("INSERT INTO bookmarks VALUES(2, 'http://www.destroyallsoftware.com');")
    connection.exec("INSERT INTO bookmarks VALUES(3, 'http://www.google.com');")

    visit('/bookmarks')

    expect(page).to have_content "http://www.makersacademy.com"
    expect(page).to have_content "http://www.destroyallsoftware.com"
    expect(page).to have_content "http://www.google.com"
  end
end
